      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Logan. I love technology and video games! I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed tinkering and playing with electronics and learning about tech since I was barely old enough to hold a PlayStation 1 controller.  Growing up, I would often help my parents and neighbors with their tech issues or questions (and still do). If I didn&amp;rsquo;t know an answer to an problem, I would attempt to find it and solve. This path led me to pursue a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science and a career in IT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
