# Hi, my name is Logan!
**I love technology and video games!** 

I’ve always enjoyed tinkering and playing with electronics and learning about tech since I was barely old enough to hold a PlayStation 2 controller. Growing up, I would often help my parents and neighbors with their tech issues or questions (and still do). If I didn’t know an answer to an problem, I would attempt to find it and solve. This path led me to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science and a career in IT.
